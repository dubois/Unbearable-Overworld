You are a bear but for some reason your oxygen comes from hugging
people. Problem is that hugging people breaks their
bones. #Poeticgaming


Mac users: run "run.command" from the finder
Windows users: run "run.bat" from the explorer


Controls:

WASD moves the bear in third person view.

The vertical position of the mouse in the window controls the acceleration
of the arms.  Huge bear arms are hard to operate precisely, so be careful!
Keep them open to allow people into hugging range in the first person view.

Watch for the bear's emotional and oxygen state in the second person view.
